# RFID_Doorbell
Hardware to visually alert in the work area that the doorbell button has been pushed.


A WIFI enabled Arduino that will accept GET requests such as *http://ip.address/doorbell*.  This will trigger the the defaul action to flash a set of 10 NeoPixles that are housed in a translucent 3D Printed enclosure.  

The schematic, arduino sketch and enclosure model are coming soon.

I'll try to come up with a few ideas for the enclosure we can review.
